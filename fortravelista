My name is Alice Ross and I'm a passionate globetrotter, writer and founder of Fortravelista. I've always been intrigued by different cultures around the world, and so I decided to leave my desk job behind a few years ago to see more of it. That's when Fortravelista was born with the hope of inspiring and sharing my love of traveling with the others. The story doesn't end there, if you want to see more of my journey, don't forget to follow me on social media!
